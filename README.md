# FINAL-PROJECT
FINAL PROJECT CONCEPT
1 MY FINAL PROJECT WILL BE A FLYING DRAWING MACHINE
2 IT WILL HAVE ANTI COLLISION SENSOR/INFRA RED 
BLINKING LED 
IT WILL BE CONTROLLED BY A WIRELESS REMOTE / OR JUST FLOAT IN AIR WITH THE HELP OF SENSORS IN A CLOSED ENVIROMENT 
I WILL RECORD THE PATH OF THE MACHINE WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA WHICH WILL GIVE ME A LONG EXPOSURE DRAWING MADE BY THE MOVEMENT OF MACHINE
